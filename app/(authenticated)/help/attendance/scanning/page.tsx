            You can access the barcode scanner through multiple paths in the application:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Main Navigation:</strong> Click on "Attendance" in the sidebar, then select "Scan" from the submenu.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quick Action:</strong> Use the floating action button (FAB) at the bottom right of the screen and select the scan icon.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>PWA Shortcut:</strong> If you've installed the Progressive Web App, use the "Scan Attendance" shortcut from your device's home screen.

          <StepByStepGuide title="How to Scan Attendance" description="Follow these steps to scan student barcodes for attendance:">
            <Step number={1} title="Select a Class (Optional)">
              Before scanning, you can select a specific class from the dropdown menu. This will filter the scan results
              to show only students enroled in that class. If you don't select a class, the system will identify the student
              but may not automatically mark attendance.

              />
            </Step>

            <Step number={2} title="Prepare the Scanner">
              Ensure your camera is clean and has a clear view. For external scanners, make sure they are properly connected
              and powered on. The scanner interface will show a camera viewfinder or indicate that an external scanner is active.
            </Step>

            <Step number={3} title="Scan the Barcode">
              Position the barcode or QR code within the scanning area. Hold the device steady until the code is recognized.
              A successful scan is typically indicated by a beep sound and visual confirmation.

              <HelpCallout type="note" title="Note" className="mt-4">
                For best results, ensure adequate lighting and hold the barcode at a distance of 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) from the camera.
              </HelpCallout>
            </Step>

            <Step number={4} title="Verify the Scan">
              After a successful scan, the student's information will appear on screen. Verify that the correct student has been
              identified before proceeding.

            </Step>

            <Step number={5} title="Mark Attendance (If Required)">
              If you selected a class beforehand, attendance may be marked automatically. Otherwise, you may need to
              manually confirm attendance by clicking the "Mark Present" button.
            </Step>

            <Step number={6} title="Continue Scanning">
              Continue scanning for other students. The system keeps a log of all scans in the current session, which you
              can review at any time.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Ensure you've granted camera permissions to the application. On most browsers, you can check this by
                clicking the lock icon in the address bar and reviewing the site permissions.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Make sure there's adequate lighting and the barcode is not damaged or obscured. Try adjusting the distance
                between the camera and barcode, typically 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) works best.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                Check that your scanner is properly powered and paired with your device. For USB scanners, try a different
                port. For Bluetooth scanners, ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your device.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                If a valid barcode is scanned but the student is not found in the system, verify that the student is

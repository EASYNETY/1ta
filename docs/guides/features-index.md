# SmartEdu Educational Features Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for integrating the SmartEdu frontend educational features with the backend API. It covers the relationships between features, data structures, API endpoints, and implementation logic to ensure a seamless transition from mock data to live API data.

## Educational Features Integration Guide

The [Educational Features Integration Guide](./educational-features-integration.md) provides a high-level overview of how all the educational features are interconnected and the general requirements for integrating them with the backend API.

Key topics covered:
- Feature relationships diagram
- High-level data structures
- API endpoint overview
- Implementation logic
- Migration strategy

## Classes and Courses Integration

The [Classes and Courses Integration Guide](./classes-courses-integration.md) focuses on the core educational content features:

Key topics covered:
- Course and class data structures
- API endpoints for courses and classes
- Frontend implementation with Redux thunks
- Relationships with other features
- Migration checklist

## Schedule and Timetable Integration

The [Schedule and Timetable Integration Guide](./schedule-timetable-integration.md) covers the scheduling and visualization of educational events:

Key topics covered:
- Schedule event data structures
- API endpoints for schedule events
- Frontend implementation with Redux thunks
- Timetable visualization
- Relationships with classes and attendance
- Migration checklist

## Attendance Integration

The [Attendance Integration Guide](./attendance-integration.md) details the attendance tracking feature:

Key topics covered:
- Attendance data structures
- API endpoints for attendance records
- Frontend implementation with Redux thunks
- Barcode scanner integration
- Relationships with schedule and classes
- Migration checklist

## Migration Strategy

To ensure a smooth transition from mock data to live API data, follow these steps:

1. **Maintain Type Consistency**: Ensure backend API returns data in the same structure as the mock data
2. **Handle Nested Data**: Backend should return nested data in the same format (e.g., `response.data`)
3. **Implement Defensive Programming**: Use safe data handling utilities for all API responses
4. **Gradual Feature Migration**: Migrate one feature at a time, starting with core features (Courses → Classes → Schedule → Attendance)
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each feature after migration to ensure compatibility

## API Response Format Requirements

All API responses should follow this format to maintain compatibility with the frontend:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": {
    // Response data matching the expected types
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message",
  "errors": [
    // Optional detailed errors
  ]
}
```

## Special Considerations

### Date Handling

- All dates should be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ)
- The frontend uses date-fns for date manipulation
- Current day data is important for attendance and schedule

### Mock Data Behavior

- When `IS_LIVE_API` is false, mock data for schedule and attendance always shows current day data
- This behavior should be maintained in the live API for consistency

### Error Handling

- API errors should be handled gracefully
- The frontend uses the ApiError class for consistent error handling
- Network errors should be distinguished from API errors

## Next Steps

After reviewing this documentation:

1. Share it with the backend team
2. Discuss any questions or concerns
3. Agree on API endpoints and data structures
4. Create a timeline for implementation
5. Begin implementing the backend API
6. Test the integration with the frontend
7. Deploy the integrated solution

# Profile Page Update Report

## Summary of Changes

- Imported `fetchClassById` thunk from `features/classes/store/classes-thunks`.
- Moved the declaration of the `form` variable (using `useForm`) above the `useEffect` hook that watches the `classId` field.
- Updated the `useEffect` hook to subscribe to `form.watch` properly, listening for changes to the `classId` field and dispatching `fetchClassById` accordingly.
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to usage of `form` before declaration.
- Ensured that the form initialization and state management are consistent with React Hook Form best practices.
- Maintained existing validation, submission, and UI logic for the profile page.

## Impacted Areas

- `app/(authenticated)/profile/page.tsx` â€” main profile page component.
- Redux thunk `fetchClassById` usage for fetching class details on course selection.

## Testing Recommendations

- Verify that the profile page loads user data correctly.
- Confirm that changing the course selection triggers the `fetchClassById` thunk and updates the UI accordingly.
- Test form validation and submission flows for different user roles (student, corporate manager, teacher).
- Check onboarding flow and navigation after profile update or skipping onboarding.

## Notes

- No backend or API changes were made.
- No new dependencies were added.
- The changes improve code correctness and fix TypeScript errors.

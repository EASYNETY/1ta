## üìù **RBAC SYSTEM PLANNING**

### Current State:
- Basic role-based access exists with `admin`, `teacher`, `student` roles
- All current admin features are accessible to admin role

### Proposed 4-Tier System:
1. **Super Admin**: Full control including delete capabilities (current admin features)
2. **Admin**: Full control except analytics dashboard (hidden) and payment dashboard (read-only), no delete permissions
3. **Accounting**: Dynamic dashboard with payment history and trends charts
4. **Customer Care**: Limited access to tickets, feedback, attendance (read-only), timetable (read-only), discussion, student info (read-only)

### Implementation Notes:
- Backend coordination required for role definitions
- Frontend will implement role-based UI restrictions
- Current admin features will be migrated to Super Admin role
- New role-specific dashboards and permissions to be created

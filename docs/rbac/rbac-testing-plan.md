## 🧪 Automated Testing Setup

### Test Data Setup
\`\`\`typescript
// Mock users for testing
const testUsers = {
  superAdmin: { role: 'super_admin', permissions: ['*'] },
  admin: { role: 'admin', permissions: ['manage_users', 'view_payments'] },
  accounting: { role: 'accounting', permissions: ['manage_payments'] },
  customerCare: { role: 'customer_care', permissions: ['scan_barcodes'] },
  teacher: { role: 'teacher', permissions: ['manage_courses'] },
  student: { role: 'student', permissions: ['view_courses'] }
};
\`\`\`

### Test Utilities
\`\`\`typescript
// Helper function to test role access
const testRoleAccess = async (role: string, route: string, shouldHaveAccess: boolean) => {
  // Login with role
  // Navigate to route
  // Assert access result
};

// Helper function to test permission guards
const testPermissionGuard = (permission: string, userRole: string, shouldRender: boolean) => {
  // Render component with permission guard
  // Assert visibility
};
\`\`\`

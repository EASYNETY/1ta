# 📊 RBAC Implementation Status Report

**Project**: 1Tech Academy Platform - 4-Tier RBAC System
**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: January 26, 2025

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented the frontend components of the 4-tier RBAC system as specified in the CEO requirements. The system now supports:

- **Super Admin**: Full access including delete capabilities

- **Accounting**: Specialized payment dashboard with full payment management
- **Customer Care**: Limited read-only access with barcode scanning
- **Teacher**: Course and student management (existing)
- **Student**: Basic access to own data (existing)

## 🔄 Backend Requirements

### Critical Backend Tasks
The following backend implementations are **required** for the RBAC system to function:

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Add `super_admin`, `accounting`, `customer_care` to user_role enum
   - Add permissions column to users table
   - Add payment tracking fields (gateway_ref, transaction_id, reconciliation_status)

2. **API Middleware**
   - Role-based route protection
   - Permission-based access control
   - Audit logging for admin actions

3. **New API Endpoints**
   - `/api/admin/analytics/*` (Super Admin only)
   - `/api/accounting/*` (Accounting dashboard data)
   - `/api/customer-care/*` (Student lookup and scanning)
   - Enhanced `/api/payments/*` with reconciliation

4. **Data Models**
   - Updated User model with permissions array
   - Enhanced Payment model with tracking fields
   - Analytics data models for dashboards

**📋 Detailed backend requirements**: See `docs/backend-rbac-requirements.md`

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Permission System Design
```typescript
// Hierarchical permission checking
Super Admin → All Permissions
Admin → Subset (no analytics, no delete)
Accounting → Payment-focused permissions
Customer Care → Read-only + scanning permissions
Teacher → Course management permissions
Student → Basic access permissions
```

### Component Architecture
```
AuthProvider (Route Protection)
├── PermissionGuard (Component Protection)
├── Navigation (Role-based Filtering)
├── Dashboards (Role-specific Views)
└── API Integration (Permission Headers)
```

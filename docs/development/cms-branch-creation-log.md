## 🔄 **Ongoing Workflow**

### **Working on CMS Features**
\`\`\`bash
# Switch to CMS branch for CMS work
git checkout feature/cms-system

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(cms): add specific CMS feature"
git push origin feature/cms-system
\`\`\`

### **Regular Syncing with Main (Weekly Recommended)**
\`\`\`bash
# Sync CMS branch with latest main changes
git checkout feature/cms-system
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Resolve conflicts if any
# ... resolve conflicts ...
git add .
git commit -m "sync: merge latest main branch changes"

# Push updated branch
git push origin feature/cms-system
\`\`\`

### **When Ready to Integrate**
\`\`\`bash
# Ensure CMS branch is up to date
git checkout feature/cms-system
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Switch to main and merge CMS
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/cms-system

# Push integrated changes
git push origin main

# Optionally keep CMS branch for future development
# Or delete if no longer needed
\`\`\`

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Approach**

### **✅ Advantages**
1. **Independent Development** - CMS can be developed without affecting main branch
2. **Easy Syncing** - Regular merges keep branch up to date with main changes
3. **Selective Integration** - Can choose when and what to integrate
4. **Rollback Capability** - Easy to rollback if integration causes issues
5. **Parallel Development** - Other features can be developed on main simultaneously
6. **Complete Implementation Store** - All CMS work is preserved and organized

### **🔄 Maintenance Requirements**
1. **Weekly Syncing** - Merge main branch changes to prevent conflicts
2. **Regular Testing** - Ensure CMS branch builds and tests pass
3. **Documentation Updates** - Keep documentation current with changes
4. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle merge conflicts promptly

## 📞 **Quick Reference Commands**

### **Switch to CMS Branch**
\`\`\`bash
git checkout feature/cms-system
\`\`\`

### **Sync with Main**
\`\`\`bash
git checkout feature/cms-system
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
git push origin feature/cms-system
\`\`\`

### **Check Branch Status**
\`\`\`bash
git branch -v
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all -10
\`\`\`

### **View Changes Since Branch Creation**
\`\`\`bash
git log main..feature/cms-system --oneline
\`\`\`

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **Never force push** the CMS branch unless absolutely necessary
2. **Always sync before major changes** to avoid large conflicts
3. **Test thoroughly** before integrating to main
4. **Document all major changes** in commit messages
5. **Keep this log updated** with significant milestones

# Help Content Maintenance Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for maintaining and updating the help content in the SmartEdu frontend application.

This maintenance plan ensures that help content remains accurate, up-to-date, and valuable to users as the application evolves.

3. Content is updated and reviewed on an expedited timeline
4. Update is deployed in the next available release or hotfix

## Review Schedule

| Review Type | Frequency | Responsible Party | Deliverables |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Comprehensive Review | Quarterly | Documentation Team | Full audit report |
| Section Review | Monthly | Section Owner | Section update report |
| User Feedback Review | Bi-weekly | UX Team | Feedback summary |
| Technical Accuracy | With each release | Feature Teams | Accuracy verification |

## Content Standards

### Style Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in a friendly, helpful tone
- Use second-person perspective ("you")
- Include step-by-step instructions for processes
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include role-specific content where appropriate
- Maintain a consistent structure across similar help articles

### Content Structure

Each help article should include:

1. **Header** with title, icon, and description
2. **Introduction** explaining the topic
3. **Main content** with appropriate sections and subsections
4. **Role-specific content** for students, teachers, and administrators
5. **Related topics** linking to other relevant help articles
6. **Article footer** with navigation to previous/next articles

### Technical Requirements

- All help content must be properly indexed for search
- Help articles must be accessible and follow WCAG guidelines
- Content must be responsive and display properly on all devices
- Images must include alt text for accessibility
- Code examples must be properly formatted and syntax highlighted

## Search Integration

The help content is integrated with the platform's search functionality through the following components:

1. **Help Search Indexer** (`features/search/services/help-search-indexer.ts`)
   - Indexes all help content for searching
   - Integrates with the main search service

2. **Search Service Integration** (`features/search/services/search-service.ts`)
   - Enhances search results with help content
   - Provides specialized rendering for help search results

3. **Help Search Result Card** (`features/search/components/HelpSearchResultCard.tsx`)
   - Specialized card for displaying help search results
   - Provides context and actions specific to help content

## Metrics and Improvement

### Key Metrics to Track

- Help page views (overall and by section)
- Search queries leading to help content
- Time spent on help pages
- Feedback ratings on help articles
- Support tickets related to topics covered in help content

### Continuous Improvement Process

1. **Collect Data**
   - Track usage metrics
   - Gather user feedback
   - Monitor support tickets

2. **Analyze**
   - Identify most and least viewed help content
   - Analyze search queries that lead to help content
   - Review user feedback for patterns

3. **Improve**
   - Update content based on analysis
   - Create new content for common questions
   - Refine search integration for better discoverability

4. **Measure**
   - Track impact of changes on key metrics
   - Gather feedback on updated content

## Version Control and History

- All help content is stored in the application codebase
- Changes are tracked through git version control
- Major content updates should be documented in commit messages
- Content history should be maintained for reference

## Tooling

### Content Creation and Editing

- Help content is written in TypeScript React components
- Content structure is defined by reusable components in `@/components/help`
- Visual elements use the application's UI component library

### Content Review

- Content reviews should use pull request processes
- Automated checks for formatting and accessibility
- Manual review for accuracy and clarity

## Training and Onboarding

- New team members should be trained on help content standards
- Documentation team should provide guidance to feature teams
- Regular workshops on effective help content creation

## Conclusion

This maintenance plan ensures that the help content remains a valuable resource for users as the application evolves. By following these guidelines and processes, we can maintain high-quality, accurate, and helpful documentation that enhances the user experience and reduces support burden.

5. **Performance**: CMS should not impact public page load times
6. **Security**: Only authenticated admins can access CMS features

### Technical Requirements
1. **TypeScript Compliance**: Zero TypeScript errors throughout implementation
2. **Responsive Design**: All CMS interfaces must work on mobile devices
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
4. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all async operations
5. **Data Validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all CMS interfaces

### Performance Requirements
1. **Bundle Size**: CMS code should be code-split to avoid impacting public pages
2. **API Response Time**: All API calls should complete within 2 seconds
3. **Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and optimization
4. **Caching**: Proper caching strategies for content and media

## API Contracts

### Pages API
- `GET /api/website/pages` - List pages with pagination
- `POST /api/website/pages` - Create new page
- `GET /api/website/pages/[id]` - Get specific page
- `PUT /api/website/pages/[id]` - Update page
- `DELETE /api/website/pages/[id]` - Delete page

### Media API
- `GET /api/website/media` - List media files
- `POST /api/website/media/upload` - Upload new media
- `DELETE /api/website/media/[id]` - Delete media file

### Settings API
- `GET /api/website/settings` - Get global settings
- `PUT /api/website/settings` - Update global settings

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- All CMS endpoints require admin authentication

- Session validation for all operations

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user-generated content
- Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
- Prevent XSS and injection attacks

### Data Protection
- Secure file upload handling
- Proper error messages without sensitive data exposure
- Audit logging for all CMS operations
